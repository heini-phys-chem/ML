Machine learning scripts using qmlcode. Automatically optimizes the hyperparameter sigma and llambda (withon the training set) using cross validation and subsequently generates data for learning curves or makes predictions of new molecules.

```
python BoB.py <train.txt> <test.txt or predictions.txt> <path to xyz files> <learning_curves or predictions>
